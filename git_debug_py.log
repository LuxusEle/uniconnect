If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<branch> main


CMD: git push

ERR: fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
